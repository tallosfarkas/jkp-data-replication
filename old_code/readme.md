Note: 
At the beginning of the execution of the code, DUO may send an alert to your phone to grant access to download the data.
If the login attempts time out because you didn't grant access with DUO, stop the code and start again.

That's it, we'll take it from there.

Computer specifications: I'm running the code on 512 gb of RAM and 128 CPU cores.
